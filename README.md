Classification of handwritten digits in the classic Digits dataset.

To run, install the requirements specified in requirements.txt.

linear_regression.ipynb contains a lot of noise, but mostly follows the structure outlined in the report.
A lot of functionality has been delegated to ml_utils.py to try to get some kind of re-usability, this is also where you'll find the code used for linear regression.

cnn.ipynb contains the code used for training and optimizing our CNN. models are saved to cnn_digits_trained.model.
